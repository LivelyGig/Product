# SBT build definition

Since Scala.js is quite new and it's been evolving even rather recently, building Scala.js applications with SBT is not as clear as it could
be. Yes, the documentation and tutorials give you the basics, but what if you want something more, like put the output of the Scala.js compiler
into another directory?

The `build.scala` in this tutorial shows you some typical cases you might run into in your own application.
