# LivelyGig Product

This is the skeleton of a web application which will use the LivelyGig protocol along with SpecialK. Currently, the front-end is written in Scala.js and routing is done with spray. For now, the front end is just a file browser for demonstration purposes.

To run the LivelyGig product:  

1.) Install sbt.

2.) In the Product directory, run:
```
sbt
```
This will open sbt's interactive mode.

3.) While in sbt's interactive mode:
```
re-start
```
and wait until the application is started. This will take a long time the first time it is run.

Lastly, go to `localhost:8080` in your browser.

To stop the application:
```
re-stop
```
